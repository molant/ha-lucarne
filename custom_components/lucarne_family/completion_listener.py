"""State-change listener for managed todo entities (Phase 3-C).

Listens to state changes on all managed todo entities and appends
completion_log rows for every status transition. This is the authoritative
source for the completion log — toggle_task and other callers must NOT append
rows directly.

Reset suppression:
  reset_logic.async_perform_daily_reset marks each UID it is about to reset in
  hass.data["_lucarne_reset_pending"] (a set) before calling
  async_update_todo_item.  When this listener sees a COMPLETED→NEEDS_ACTION
  transition for a UID in that set it logs action="reset" (not "undone") and
  removes the UID from the set, so the row is written exactly once.

    State-change compatibility note (pinned HA version):
    HA's local_todo entity does NOT expose an `items` attribute on its state
    object. Instead we maintain an in-memory snapshot per entity and diff
    old-snapshot vs new-snapshot to identify which item changed status.
    A naive `if old_state != new_state: log` would fire on every attribute
    change (e.g. summary renames), producing incorrect log rows.

    HA fires state_changed during the initial state restoration window (~30 s
    after startup). Logging those would produce spurious rows for items that
    were completed before the restart. We guard with a started flag and
    EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STARTED.
