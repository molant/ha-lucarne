# Lucarne Family — Integration Guide

## Install

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HA → **HACS** → **Integrations** → **⋮** → **Custom repositories**
2. Paste `https://github.com/molant/ha-lucarne` and set Type to **Integration**
3. Search for **Lucarne Family** and click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for **Lucarne Family**
6. Enter your family name (e.g. "The Smiths") and click Submit

### Manual / developer

Copy `custom_components/lucarne_family/` to your HA `config/custom_components/` folder and restart.
The deploy script `scripts/deploy-integration.sh` automates this for dev iteration (requires
`HA_SSH_HOST` + `HA_INTEGRATION_PATH` env vars; see `.env.example`).

Only one Lucarne Family integration can be installed per HA instance.

## First run

After install, the integration:
- Creates a config entry with an empty members list.
- Creates the shared `todo.lucarne_household` entity.
- Initialises the SQLite database (`lucarne_family_<entry_id>.db` in your config directory) with
  the task and completion-log schema.
- Registers in-process `async_track_time_change` listeners for daily reset and streak check
  (no `automation.*` HA entities are created — the integration uses in-process listeners).

Open **Settings → Devices & Services → Lucarne Family → Configure** to add family members.

## Member management

Open **Settings → Devices & Services → Lucarne Family → Configure** to manage members.

### Add a member

1. Choose **Manage members → Add member**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Name** — displayed in cards (e.g. "Anna"). Must be non-empty and ≤ 50 characters.
   - **Color** — hex color (e.g. `#f5c89c`). Used for visual identification in cards.
   - **Avatar** — emoji (e.g. `🧒`) or a path under `/local/lucarne/avatars/` (Phase 6 adds upload UI).
   - **Routine preset** — choose a starting set of daily routines:
     - **School-age kid** — brush teeth, make bed, pack school bag (weekdays), kindness act, screen time off
     - **Toddler** — brush teeth, get dressed, put toys away
     - **Adult (none)** — empty; adults typically only need household chores
3. Click Submit. The member is saved. A stable **slug** is derived from the name (e.g. "Anna" → `anna`).

### Edit a member

1. Choose **Manage members → Edit member**.
2. Select the member to edit.
3. Update name, color, avatar, or preset.
4. Click Submit.

**Name-change and slug behavior**: If the new name produces the same slug as the old name (e.g. "Anna" → "ANNA"), only the display name changes — no entity rename occurs. If the slug would change (e.g. "Anna" → "Ana"), the flow shows an impact preview listing automations, scripts, scenes, and dashboards that reference the old entity IDs. You must check "I understand" before proceeding.

On confirm: the todo and streak-counter entity IDs are renamed, all SQLite rows (`task_metadata`, `completion_log`) are migrated to the new slug, and the config entry is updated. If entity rename fails, all SQLite changes are rolled back so member data stays consistent.

### Remove a member

1. Choose **Manage members → Remove member**.
2. Select the member.
3. Type the member's exact name to confirm. This is destructive and cannot be undone.

Removing a member deletes the `todo.<slug>` config entry (which removes the todo entity and its stored items) and the `counter.<slug>_streak` helper. The member entry is dropped from the config entry.

SQLite `task_metadata` and `completion_log` rows keyed to the removed member's slug are left in place — no member-level cleanup is performed.

> **Known limitation**: if you re-add a member with the same name (same slug), their orphaned task metadata resurfaces. The new todo list will be empty, but the WebSocket API will report the old task metadata, and preset seeding will be skipped if historical `source="template"` rows exist. A clean re-add flow (with explicit old-data cleanup) is deferred to a future phase.

## Task management

### Managed entities

When a member is added, the integration creates two managed helpers:

| Entity | Pattern | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Todo list | `todo.<slug>` | Holds the member's tasks (routines and chores) |
| Counter | `counter.<slug>_streak` | Mirror of the computed streak for use in automations (Phase 3 writes the value; Phase 2 only creates/renames/deletes the helper) |

A shared household todo list (`todo.lucarne_household`) is created once at integration setup and is not tied to any specific member.

### Task types

Every task is one of two types. Pick the type by what the task **does next** after
you check it off, not by how often you do it.

| Behavior | `routine` | `chore` |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-reset at `reset_time` (flips `completed` → `needs_action` next day) | **yes** — by `reset_logic.py` | no, stays checked |
| Counts toward streak (`counter.<slug>_streak`) | yes — when its RRULE is due today | no |
| RRULE has any runtime effect | yes — drives "is this due today?" via `recurrence.py` | no — silently ignored |
| Recurrence picker shown in **Add Task** UI | yes | no — hidden |
| Due-date field shown in **Add Task** UI | no | yes — `<input type="datetime-local">` |
| Card visibility toggle (`lucarne-chores-card`) | `show_routines` (default true) | `show_tasks` (default true) |
| Default when `type` is omitted from `add_task` | — | yes (see `task_service.py`) |

> **Household-list exemption.** Tasks on the shared `todo.lucarne_household`
> list are skipped by both `reset_logic.py` and `streak_logic.py`, which only
> iterate per-member lists. A `type: routine` task added to the household
> list won't auto-reset or count toward any streak (the UI doesn't prevent
> this combination — Add Task allows Household + Routine — but the runtime
> ignores it). Use `chore` for shared items.

> **Service contract vs. UI affordance.** The backend `add_task` service
> accepts `recurrence` *and* `due` for any `type` — there is no schema-level
> type-gate. (`update_task_metadata` only mutates metadata fields — `icon`,
> `recurrence`, `type`, `assignee`, `time_of_day` — and never touches the due date;
> due-date edits on existing items go through HA's built-in
> `todo.update_item`, which is what **Edit Task** calls when you change the
> Due field on a routine.) The differences above are: (a) which fields the
> **Add Task** popover exposes (Recurrence: routine-only; Due: chore-only),
> and (b) which fields the runtime actually consumes (RRULEs on chores are
> stored but never replayed). Developers calling `add_task` from Developer
> Tools can pass either field for either type.

**Rule of thumb.** Use `routine` for the daily-rhythm stuff your family does every
day or every weekday — brushing teeth, making the bed, packing bags. The auto-reset
+ streak loop is the whole point. Use `chore` for everything else: errands,
one-offs, occasional jobs ("clean the garage", "renew passport") — they stay
checked once done and you'll create another the next time it's due.

A `chore` that you also want on a schedule (e.g. "water plants weekly") is
currently a manual workflow — you'll re-add the chore each time. There is no
"regenerate chore on RRULE" logic today; the Add Task form intentionally hides
Recurrence when type is `chore` to avoid implying otherwise.

### Time-of-day buckets

Every task carries an optional `time_of_day` tag with one of four values:
`anytime` (the default), `morning`, `afternoon`, or `night`. This is purely
a display attribute — it does not change reset/streak logic or RRULE
evaluation. The chores card groups a member's routines into per-bucket
sub-sections (Morning → Afternoon → Night → Anytime, empty buckets hidden).
Chores currently keep their due-date-first sort; the tag is stored on chores
too for future filtering. Pre-existing rows from before this column existed
backfill to `anytime` via the schema migration in `store.py`.

### Recurrence rules

Routines use a strict subset of iCalendar RRULE syntax. Only these six modes are accepted:

| Mode | RRULE template | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| One-off | empty string | `""` |
| Daily | `FREQ=DAILY[;INTERVAL=N]` | `FREQ=DAILY` |
| Weekly | `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=<MO,TU,...>[;INTERVAL=N]` | `FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR` |
| Monthly by date | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=<1-31>[;INTERVAL=N]` | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=15;INTERVAL=6` |
| Monthly by Nth weekday | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=<+/-N><DAY>[;INTERVAL=N]` | `FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=1SA` |
| Yearly | `FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=<1-12>;BYMONTHDAY=<1-31>[;INTERVAL=N]` | `FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=3;BYMONTHDAY=15` |

Any RRULE outside this set is rejected at schema validation time (before the handler runs).

### Preset seeding

When a new member is added with a non-empty preset, the integration seeds their todo list with the preset's routine templates exactly once. A reload of the integration does not re-seed (the idempotency guard checks for existing `source="template"` metadata rows).

### Streak computation

The streak is computed by walking backward from today:
- Days where no routines are scheduled are skipped.
- Days where all scheduled routines are marked completed increment the streak.
- The first day where any scheduled routine is missing stops the walk.
- The walk is capped at 365 days.

**Known limitation**: streak computation uses the *current* routine set for all historical days. If a routine is added or removed, historical streak values may shift. This will be addressed in a future phase by snapshotting the routine set at reset time.

### Avatar upload

Avatars are uploaded via the `lucarne_family.upload_avatar` service. The service:
- Accepts PNG, JPEG, or WebP; max 2 MB; max 16,777,216 total pixels (e.g. 4096 × 4096).
- Validates the file type via magic-byte check (independent of the declared `mime_type`).
- Writes to `<config>/www/lucarne/avatars/<slug>.<ext>` (served at `/local/lucarne/avatars/<slug>.<ext>`).
- Rejects path traversal — the filename is always derived from the member slug, never from user input.

### Rename behavior

**Display-name-only rename** (slug unchanged): only `member.name` is updated. No entity rename, no downstream impact.

**Slug-changing rename**: The options flow shows an impact preview before proceeding. Impact lists:
- YAML-based automations/scripts/scenes that reference the old entity ID.
- Lovelace dashboards (`.storage/lovelace*`) that reference the old entity ID.

> **Limitation (v1)**: UI-created automations stored in `.storage/` are not scanned. Only YAML-based resources are detected. This will be addressed in a future phase.

On confirm:
1. SQLite rows (task_metadata, completion_log) migrated to new slug atomically.
2. Todo entity renamed in entity registry (`todo.<old_slug>` → `todo.<new_slug>`).
3. Streak counter deleted and recreated under new slug (preserving current streak value in initial).
4. Config entry member data updated.

If the SQLite migration (step 1) or entity rename (step 2–3) fails, the partial changes are rolled back before returning. If the final config-entry save (step 4) fails after the entities have already been renamed, the entities remain under the new slug — the config entry will reflect the old slug until the next successful options-flow submission.

## Schedule settings and managed automations

Choose **Edit schedule** to adjust:

- **Daily reset time** (default `04:00`) — when routine tasks flip back to `needs_action`.
- **Streak check time** (default `21:00`) — when the streak counter is recomputed.

### How managed automations work

The integration registers in-process `async_track_time_change` listeners at the configured times.
There are no `automation.*` HA entities to view or edit — the behavior is driven entirely inside
the integration process.

**Daily reset** (`perform_daily_reset` service, fired at `reset_time`):

- For every member, iterates their `todo.<slug>` items.
- Items with `type=routine` that are in `completed` state are flipped back to `needs_action`.
- Idempotent: items already in `needs_action` are untouched (safe to trigger multiple times).
- The completion listener detects the resulting state changes and appends `action="reset"` rows
  to the completion log (distinct from `action="undone"` for user-initiated unchecks).

**Streak check** (`evaluate_all_streaks` service, fired at `streak_check_time`):

- For every member, recomputes the streak by walking backward through the completion log.
- Writes the result to `counter.<slug>_streak` via `counter.set_value`.
- No-routine days are skipped; all-complete days increment; any-missing day stops the walk.
- Cap: 365 days maximum walk.

**Changing the times**: open Settings → Devices & Services → Lucarne Family → Configure →
Edit schedule, enter the new times, and submit. The listeners are re-registered immediately — no
HA restart required.

## Card usage

Once the integration is installed and at least one member is added, drop the
`lucarne-chores-card` onto your dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:lucarne-chores-card
title: Chores           # optional, default "Chores"
members:
  - anna                # member slug (derived from member name: "Anna" → "anna")
  - bob
  - household           # optional; shows todo.lucarne_household
show_routines: true     # optional, default true; show routine-type tasks
show_tasks: true        # optional, default true; show chore-type tasks due today or overdue
show_streak: true       # optional, default true; show streak counter in column footer
```

The visual editor (click **Visual editor** after adding the card) populates the member
checkbox list from the integration automatically.

### What the card does

- **Subscribes** to each member's `todo.<slug>` entity and to `counter.<slug>_streak` via
  the HA WebSocket — no polling.
- **Filters tasks** per column: routines are always shown (if `show_routines: true`); chores
  are shown only if their `due` date is today or earlier, or has no due date.
- **+ Add task**: opens an inline popover that calls `lucarne_family.add_task`.
- **Tap a task**: calls `todo.update_item` to toggle `needs_action ↔ completed`.
- **Long-press a task**: opens the edit popover (update summary, type, recurrence, due date,
  assignee for household tasks; or delete with confirmation).

### Household column

The special slug `household` resolves to `todo.lucarne_household`, the shared todo list
created at integration setup. Household tasks may have an optional `assignee` (a member
slug) stored as metadata. The assignee is stored and surfaced in the edit popover but is not
displayed in the task row (planned for a future phase). The household column has no streak
subscription; if `show_streak` is enabled, it renders 0.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Integration not visible in Add Integration | Verify `custom_components/lucarne_family/` is in the right location and `manifest.json` is present. Restart HA after adding. |
| Setup errors or missing entities | Check HA logs (Settings → System → Logs) and filter for `lucarne_family`. |
| Member's todo entity missing after adding | Trigger a reload: Settings → Devices & Services → Lucarne Family → ⋮ → Reload. The reconciliation loop recreates missing entities. |
| Streaks not updating | Check HA logs (Settings → System → Logs) for `lucarne_family` entries around the configured `streak_check_time`. To force an immediate recompute, call `lucarne_family.evaluate_all_streaks` from Developer Tools → Services. Also confirm your HA timezone matches the `streak_check_time` value. |
| Chores card shows error block | The integration is either not installed or the `lucarne_family/get_family` WebSocket command failed. Check HA logs. |

## Round-trip readiness (v0.2)

The integration can fire a round-trip event when apple-synced items are completed in HA, so a
future subscriber can mark the corresponding Apple Reminder complete on the Mac mini.

### Enable round-trip config

**Settings → Devices & Services → Lucarne Family → Configure → Apple Reminders sync**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Enable round-trip | Toggle. Leave off until the future receiver is deployed. |
| Webhook URL | The URL the future subscriber will POST to (e.g. `http://mac-mini.local:9123/writeback`). |
| Shared secret | Min 32 characters. Used for HMAC-SHA256 signing by the future subscriber. |
| Sync device name | Displayed in the event payload for receiver identification. Default: "Sync device". |

### What happens when enabled

When `enabled == true` and an apple-sourced task with a non-empty `apple_uid` is marked complete,
the integration fires `lucarne_family_apple_writeback_requested` on the HA bus. The payload
contains `apple_uid`, `status`, `timestamp`, and `device_name`. **The webhook URL and secret are
never in the event.** Tasks without an `apple_uid` (e.g. added manually) do not trigger the event.

The actual POST to the bridge is deferred — no HTTP request is made in v0.2. Enable this now
to verify events appear in **Developer Tools → Events**, then wire the subscriber in the next spec.

### What is missing

The webhook POST and HMAC signing are not implemented yet. See
[`docs/reminders-bridge.md` — Round-trip writeback](reminders-bridge.md#round-trip-writeback)
for the full protocol and the subscriber accessor contract (`get_round_trip_config(hass)`).

## Deprecation notes

- **`ha_lucarne_chores_all_done`** event: fired as a compatibility shim alongside `lucarne_family_all_routines_done` in v0.x. Will be removed in v1.0. Migrate consumers:
  ```yaml
  # Old:
  trigger:
    - trigger: event
      event_type: ha_lucarne_chores_all_done
  # New:
  trigger:
    - trigger: event
      event_type: lucarne_family_all_routines_done
      event_data:
        member: anna  # member slug
  ```

- **`lucarne_chores_daily_reset` / `lucarne_chores_streak_advance` blueprints**: retired. Delete any instances — the integration handles these automatically.

- **`kids:` chores card config**: old YAML shape is not migrated. The card shows an upgrade message; configure via the integration instead.
