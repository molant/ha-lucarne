# CLAUDE.md — ha-lucarne

Working guide for AI sessions. Covers what you'd get wrong without it.

## Project overview

Single-distribution HACS repo (one `integration` install ships both halves):

- **Integration** (`custom_components/lucarne_family/`) — Python HA integration that owns family members, managed entities (`todo.<slug>`, `counter.<slug>_streak`), SQLite task/completion storage, and in-process time-change listeners for daily reset and streak check.
- **Frontend** (`custom_components/lucarne_family/frontend/ha-lucarne.js`) — three Lit-based Lovelace cards: `lucarne-today-card`, `lucarne-calendar-card`, `lucarne-chores-card`. Single ESM bundle; no code splitting. The integration's `async_setup` serves this file at `FRONTEND_URL` (`/lucarne_family_frontend/ha-lucarne.js`) and calls `add_extra_js_url` so the cards auto-register — **no HACS plugin, no manual Lovelace resource.**

Two test runners (node:test + pytest), one deploy target.

## Build & test

### TypeScript (cards)

```bash
npm run build         # Vite build → custom_components/lucarne_family/frontend/ha-lucarne.js (single ESM, committed)
npm test              # node:test runner (NOT vitest — see pitfalls)
npm run test:coverage # same suite + Node coverage, fails under line 88 / branch 80 / funcs 73 (CI gate)
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint          # eslint src
```

CI runs `test:coverage`, not `test`. The thresholds are floored from the
current numbers — raise them as coverage improves, never lower to make a PR
pass. `npm test` stays coverage-free for fast local iteration.

The built bundle is **committed** — HACS ships repo files for an integration and does not run a build. Rebuild and commit `frontend/ha-lucarne.js` whenever card sources change.

### Python (integration)

```bash
# From repo root (pyproject.toml is here)
ruff check custom_components/lucarne_family/
mypy custom_components/lucarne_family/
pytest tests/python/   # coverage on by default (addopts); fails under statement floor 86
```

Coverage is wired into pytest `addopts`, so a bare `pytest` reports it and
enforces `fail_under = 86` (statement coverage) from `[tool.coverage.report]`.

pytest requires `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`. Install dev deps:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Both (baseline gate before any commit)

```bash
npm run test:coverage && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build
pytest tests/python/
```

Use `test:coverage` here (not `test`) so the local gate matches CI's coverage
floors. Bare `pytest` already enforces the Python floor via `addopts`.

## Deploy

One script bypasses HACS for fast iteration. HACS is the install path for end users only.

```bash
# Builds the card bundle into frontend/, then rsyncs the whole integration.
# Requires: HA_SSH_HOST, HA_INTEGRATION_PATH (must end in /custom_components/lucarne_family)
./scripts/deploy-integration.sh                # build + rsync
./scripts/deploy-integration.sh --skip-build   # rsync existing frontend/ as-is
```

Set env vars in `.env` at the project root (see `.env.example`). A card-only change still requires an
HA restart (or at least a re-setup) for the new bundle to be served, plus a hard browser refresh —
the cards no longer hot-reload from a standalone `/www/lucarne` path.

## Test runner conventions

- **TypeScript**: `node:test` (Node's built-in). Import: `import { describe, it, afterEach } from 'node:test'`. **Not vitest** — `import { describe } from 'vitest'` will fail silently.
- **Run a single TS test file**: `TZ=America/Los_Angeles node --import tsx --import ./tests/setup/dom-globals.mjs --test tests/path/file.test.ts`. The `TZ`, `tsx` loader, and `dom-globals.mjs` are load-bearing; bare `node --test` will fail.
- **Python**: `pytest` with `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`. Fixtures: `hass`, `enable_custom_integrations`. Tests live in `tests/python/`.

## HACS distribution

Single HACS item — `integration` category only. The cards ride along inside the integration package and are auto-registered by `async_setup`; there is **no** `plugin` category and **no** separate Dashboard registration.

| Surface | Category | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Integration + cards | `integration` | `custom_components/lucarne_family/` (cards at `frontend/ha-lucarne.js`) |

`hacs.json` carries only integration-level keys (`name`, `render_readme`, `homeassistant`) — the plugin-only `filename`/`content_in_root` keys were removed.

## Common pitfalls

- **`node:test` not vitest**: Writing vitest imports silently prevents tests from running.
- **No HA automation entities from this integration**: `automation_writer.py` registers in-process `async_track_time_change` listeners — it does **not** create `automation.*` HA entities. There are no `automation.lucarne_*` entities in the UI. To change reset/streak times, use the integration's Options flow (`CONF_RESET_TIME`, `CONF_STREAK_CHECK_TIME`), not the Automations UI.
- **No blocking I/O in async HA code**: Use `hass.async_add_executor_job(...)` for blocking calls (heavy SQLite migrations, file I/O). Never block the event loop.
- **Entity rename has downstream impact**: Slug-changing renames go through `rename.py` which shows an impact preview before proceeding; never rename entities outside that flow.
- **Integration uses `lucarne_family.*` services and `lucarne_family_*` events**: The older `ha_lucarne_chores_all_done` event is a deprecated compat shim still fired by `completion_listener.py` in v0.x alongside `lucarne_family_all_routines_done`. Migrate consumers to the new event; see `docs/events.md`.
- **RRULE math**: Use `dateutil.rrule` via `recurrence.py` (Python) and `parseRRule`/`isRoutineDueToday` from `src/shared/recurrence.ts` (JS). Never hand-roll date arithmetic.
- **Avatar writes**: Only permitted write path under `<config>/www/` is `/local/lucarne/avatars/`. `avatar_service.py` enforces this; tests must cover path-traversal cases.
- **SQLite file in `<config>/` root**: Name pattern: `lucarne_family_<entry_id>.db`. Never hardcode the entry ID.
- **Avatar center-square crop is deferred**: The upload modal accepts any aspect ratio; `avatar_service.py` stores raw uploaded bytes. A future spec should add `PIL ImageOps.fit` centering in `_write_avatar`. Do not add it without a spec.
- **Round-trip event vs POST**: `completion_listener.py` fires `lucarne_family_apple_writeback_requested` when `round_trip.enabled == true` but does **not** POST to the webhook. The POST is deferred to a future spec. Future subscribers **must** call `get_round_trip_config(hass)` from `__init__.py` — never read `entry.data["round_trip"]` directly, to survive storage layout changes.
- **`set_member_avatar` emoji validation**: Uses explicit Unicode block ranges (U+1F000–U+1FAFF, U+2300–U+27FF, U+2B00–U+2BFF, U+1F1E0–U+1F1FF). Requires at least one base-emoji codepoint; allows ZWJ-joined compound emoji (e.g., family/profession glyphs); rejects ASCII text, invisible-only strings, and unjoined back-to-back emoji.

## Don'ts

- **Don't** write HA automations for the time-based triggers — the integration's listeners own these.
- **Don't** hand-roll RRULE date math — use `recurrence.py` (Python) or `recurrence.ts` (JS).
- **Don't** write files to `<config>/www/` outside `/local/lucarne/avatars/`.
- **Don't** add `contributing.md`, `code_of_conduct.md`, or other meta docs unless asked.
- **Don't** generate vitest imports in test files.
- **Don't** split the ESM bundle or re-introduce a separate HACS `plugin` distribution — the integration serves and registers the single bundle itself.
- **Don't** implement the round-trip webhook POST without a spec — only the HA event is fired in v0.2.
- **Don't** add server-side center-square crop to `avatar_service.py` without a spec — the deferred design is documented in CLAUDE.md and the phase-6 spec.
